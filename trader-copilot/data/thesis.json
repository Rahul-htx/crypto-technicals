Defensive stance remains in force until breadth, liquidity and BTC dominance improve.\n\n## \"High-Conviction\" Filter  \nWe now deploy capital **only** into trade ideas that score **≥ 8 / 10** on our conviction scale.  \nConviction is a weighted blend of macro, on-chain, technical and news catalysts.  \nSub-8 ideas may be tracked but **not executed**.\n\n## Core Strategic Set-ups  \n### 1) Bitcoin (BTC) – ONLY two actionable plays  \n• **Flush-Buy Zone** (Accumulate): $108 000 → $104 000 (200-day EMA pocket & 0.382 Fib of Feb-Aug leg).  \n  – Size: 25 % / 25 % / 50 % ladder.  \n  – Stop: weekly close < $100 000.  \n  – Target (6-24 m): $140 k first, $165-180 k stretch.  \n  – Conviction: 8 / 10 once price trades in the zone.\n\n• **Break-Out Confirmation**: Daily close > $120 000 **AND** 30-day OBV to new highs (≥1.5 × 30-day avg volume).  \n  – Entry: $120-123 k.  \n  – Initial risk: to $114 k.  \n  – Same targets as above.  \n  – Conviction: 8 / 10 on trigger.\n\nNo new BTC trade if spot sits between $108 k and $120 k.\n\n### 2) Ethereum (ETH) – Contingent Play  \nActivates only after BTC triggers. Preferred entry = pullback to the weekly 20 EMA (~$4 200-4 350) **OR** BTC breakout with ETH daily close > previous ATH $4 946 on volume.  \nConviction max 7 / 10 → track, not act until upgraded.\n\n### 3) Chainlink (LINK) & Other Alts  \nSuspended until Risk-On flip **AND** alt-guardrails pass:  \n– BTC.D ≤ 56 % and falling  \n– Total crypto m-cap positive d/d and >200-day MA  \n\n## Sizing & Risk  \n• High-conviction positions: 1.0 × normal sizing permitted.  \n• Anything < 8/10 = 0 sizing.  \n• Maintain ≥50 % portfolio cash until a BTC trigger fires.\n\n## Guardrails (Unchanged)  \n• De-risk all alts if total m-cap −≥2.5 % d/d or BTC.D > 56.5 %.  \n\n## Regime Shift Triggers  \n• Flip Risk-On only if BTC & ETH reclaim and hold daily 20 EMA **and** breadth improves (total m-cap + BTC.D rollover).  \n\n## Actionable Summary  \n1) **Stand-by**: No trade at current $112 k BTC.  \n2) Auto-bids layered $108-104 k (flush) and alert set for daily close >$120 k (breakout).  \n3) ETH/LINK on hold until BTC conviction signal.  \n4) Preserve capital; keep cash heavy.",
