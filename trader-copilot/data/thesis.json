Avoid chasing high-beta alts until breadth improves.\n\n## Focus & Trade Criteria\n• BTC – Intraday mean-reversion longs only after RSI <30 then closes back inside the lower Bollinger Band. Quick partials at VWAP / mid-band.\n• ETH – Swing “buy-the-dip” toward the daily 20 EMA / mid-band. Scale only when momentum turns (RSI uptick and MACD crossover). No breakout buys while risk-off.\n• LINK – Optional, conservative execution only:\n  – Setup: Wait for a 1h pullback into the Bollinger mid-band (20,2) / 20 EMA. Do not chase strength near/above the upper band under risk-off.\n  – Confirmation: Take entries only when 1h momentum re-accelerates: RSI(14) curls up and crosses 50 AND MACD histogram flips positive (>0). Prefer alignment with improving volume/OBV.\n  – Targets: First partial at VWAP / mid-band reclaim. Secondary at prior swing high / upper band.\n  – Risk: Hard stop below the session low by 0.25–0.5 ATR (1h). If fading strength, hard stop above the local high by 0.25–0.5 ATR. Size ≤0.5× normal.\n  – Fade-only condition (scalp): If price extends to/above the upper band with RSI >65 and weak OBV/volume confirmation, consider a small fade back to VWAP/mid-band. Tight stops; scalpers only.\n\n## Sizing & Risk\nPosition 0.5–0.75 × normal (≤0.5× on LINK). Tighter stops. Minimize overnight exposure.\n\n## Alt Guardrails (applies to LINK and other alts)\nOnly engage if BOTH are true:\n– Total crypto m-cap is not down more than 2.5% day-over-day, and\n– BTC dominance (BTC.D) is ≤56.5% and not trending higher.\nStand aside or de-risk alts if either condition fails.\n\n## Regime Shift Triggers\nFlip risk-on if:\n– Total crypto m-cap turns positive day-over-day and market breadth improves.\n– BTC.D rolls over from ≈56%.\n– BTC & ETH both reclaim and hold the daily 20 EMA on rising volume.\n\nDe-risk further if:\n– Total m-cap drops >2.5% d/d,\n– BTC.D pushes >56.5% and persists, or\n– BTC prints fresh lows with RSI <25 without a re-entry signal.\n\n## Actionable Summary\n1) Thesis unchanged – regime remains risk-off until triggers confirm otherwise.\n2) BTC: Only take the lower-BB re-entry long; scale out quickly at VWAP/mid-band; hard stop = session low −0.25%.\n3) ETH: Queue swing-long bids near the daily 20 EMA; require 1h RSI inflection + MACD uptick. Stop: Daily close below key support/20 EMA pocket.\n4) LINK: Optional trade only on a 1h dip to the mid-band with momentum confirmation (RSI>50 + MACD hist >0). First partial at VWAP/mid-band, then prior high/upper band. Stops tight (0.25–0.5 ATR). Size ≤0.5×.\n5) Keep overnight risk light; clip intraday profits.",
