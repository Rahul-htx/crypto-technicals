Avoid chasing high-beta alts until breadth improves.\n\n## Focus & Trade Criteria\n• BTC – Intraday mean-reversion longs **only after** RSI <30 then closes back **inside** the lower Bollinger Band.  Quick partials at VWAP / mid-band.\n• ETH – Swing “buy-the-dip” toward the daily 20 EMA / mid-band.  Scale only when momentum turns (RSI uptick **and** MACD crossover).  No breakout buys while risk-off.\n\n## Sizing & Risk\nPosition 0.5–0.75 × normal.  Tighter stops.  Minimise overnight exposure.\n\n## Regime Shift Triggers\nFlip **risk-on** if:\n– Total crypto m-cap turns positive day-over-day **and** market breadth improves.\n– BTC.D rolls over from ≈56 %.\n– BTC & ETH both reclaim and hold the daily 20 EMA on rising volume.\n\nDe-risk further if:\n– Total m-cap drops >2.5 % d/d,\n– BTC.D pushes >56.5 % and persists, or\n– BTC prints fresh lows with RSI <25 without a re-entry signal.\n\n## Actionable Summary (as of latest 02:48 UTC snapshot)\n1. Thesis unchanged – regime remains **risk-off**.\n2. BTC: Oversold (RSI 26.9) but **no long** until a 15 m / 1 h close back inside the lower Bollinger Band.  Target: VWAP / mid-band; hard stop = session low −0.25 %.\n3. ETH: Do **not** chase.  Queue swing-long bids in the $4.60 k pocket near the 20 EMA.  Confirmation: 1 h RSI inflection + MACD uptick.  Stop: Daily close < $4.50 k.\n4. Position size 0.5–0.75 ×, clip intraday profits, keep overnight risk light.\n",
